# Bingo Caller App

## Description
Every year on New Year's Eve, my family and I have a tradition of playing Bingo together, and we would normally call numbers out using physical balls. Then I thought that I create a virtual version of the Bingo Caller App, where this would:
- Allow the caller to play.
- Show all called numbers to everyone seated to prevent questions about if the number has been called out previously or not.

I created this app using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Running the App
Simply clone this repository locally, and then open "index.html" in any browser!

## Usage
Run the app and click "Start", which will draw one number
Then click "Draw Number" to call another number.
When all 75 numbers are called out, then trying to draw another number would alert the user that there are no more numbers to draw.

Clicking "Restart" at any point will clear the board and await the user to start the game again.

**Enjoy :)**
